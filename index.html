  <p>As we all know how to train your dragon ended on toothless parting from hiccup. Well I have an idea what if the hidden world was different? And toothless never died.</p>

  <p>Here this was a sad ending and I think people should not just go along with this. So just sign this petition to change this</p>

    <p>Now what is the hidden world was better and dragons could be better we coluld all do with the change. Sign it and hope for a better ending and a better hidden world</p>

  <button id="signButton">Sign Petition</button>
  <div id="counter">People signed: 0</div>

  <script>
    // Load saved names from localStorage or start with empty array
    let signers = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('signers') || '[]');
    const signButton = document.getElementById('signButton');
    const counterDiv = document.getElementById('counter');

    // Update counter on page load
    counterDiv.textContent = `People signed: ${signers.length}`;

    signButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const firstName = prompt('Please enter your first name:');
      if (firstName && firstName.trim() !== '') {
        const trimmedName = firstName.trim();
        signers.push(trimmedName);
        localStorage.setItem('signers', JSON.stringify(signers));
        counterDiv.textContent = `People signed: ${signers.length}`;
        alert(`Thank you for signing, ${trimmedName}!`);
      } else {
        alert('Please enter a valid first name to sign.');
      }
    });
